In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork.

She actively engages with her fans online, fostering a supportive and inclusive community. Her advocacy for mental health awareness extends beyond her music, as she speaks out on the importance of seeking help and normalizing conversations about mental illness.
